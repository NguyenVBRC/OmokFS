## Description
Information is scattered everywhere.
A player must search through multiple resources to find what they need.

By gathering all of the most frequently searched and used information, I was able to create a page that hosted all of the information in one useful and convenient location. Used by my peers and players of the community, I increased player satisfaction resulting in a more smooth player progression.

By creating a resource that provides the necessary resources in one area, I reduced search time and increased player efficiency in the community.
